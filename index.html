    <h3>Background</h3>

  <div>
    <p>What good is data without a good plot to tell the story? So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:
    </p>
    <p>While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

    <h3>Observations</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Total population of unique mice per drug regimen was predominantly even across all regimens. Gender representation in the test mouse population was almost even as well, with male just slightly over at 50.4%.</li>
        <li>Of the four drug regimen's highlighted, very few oberved tumor volumes were outliers compared to the rest of the data. </li>
        <li>Reviewing the test results for one mouse on Capomulin, tumor volume decreases as time increases, showing a steady decline.</li>
        <li>There seems to be a correlation between average tumor volume and test mouse weight. Both increase in tangent, with a standard correlation coefficient of .84 </li>
